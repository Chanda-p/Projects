__label__1 "i really like the red version of this shirt . it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace for the weekend . i am 137 lbs a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly ."
__label__0 "it was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me . i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite i 'd try it . it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy ."
__label__1 "these are very cute but very very stiff . have washed 3x and still not relaxing . not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear . my waist is smaller and generally have gap in waist to get fit right in hips . super cute with sandals mules duck boots ."
__label__-1 "i was very disappointed in the quality of this top . the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front . i had to pull the thread under so it was n't exposed . i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine . this top is extremely delicate and does n't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it 's s casual lightweight sweater . now it 's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt ."
__label__1 "this dress is just absolutely adorable ! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress ! this dress does run a tad bit large - i 'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me . best purchase yet !"
__label__1 "this dress is gorgeous- it 's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is ! i found it to fit tts . although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam it fits perfectly . if you have a bigger chest ( d+ ) i would foresee this dress being too snug . however i am a c and it fits just right ! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo"

__label__0 "yes i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away . it 's not mean for everybody . it would look good on a stick figure . if you have some hips they balloon out ."
__label__1 "i wear this out but it 's also a super comfortable to lounge around the house in . i measure 35 28 40 ( 6 through the top 10 in the bottom ) . i ordered a medium based on comments from other users concerning the top and it being constricting . i did n't find that to be true but for a closer fit i probably should have ordered the small . overall this is a fun dress to wear ."
__label__1 "i ordered this online but i own the vest and i love it so i took a chance . this is a super comfy great quality jacket . the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive . the color i ordered the green is perfect . i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking . they look exactly like the picture so if you do n't mind that you will probably be very happy with this jacket . it just was n't for me . i ended"
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top . i really love the design . alas however it is too big for my frame . for reference i am barely 5 ' 1 and about 105 lbs . i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me . it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place . the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits . i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp . i am going to have to part with it sadly ."
__label__1 "just received yesterday & i love this skirt ! it 's crazy soft very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate . great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath . sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves . only annoyance is it 's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit . you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk . i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly ( i 'm 5 ' 9 & usually a 6 ) . t"

__label__-1 "i purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style . it fit great the first time i wore it . i washed it once according to the care instructions . after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry it was basically ruined . it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches . i 'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute ."
__label__0 "bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost . fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly . did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack . gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag . returned it ."
__label__1 "i adore this dress . i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me . it is so easy to throw on and yet it 's stylish and flattering- i do n't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this . when i bought it it was knotted on one side in the front . that 's the only way i wear it now . it just adds something to it and gives it more shape . i 've washed it several times ( laid flat to dry ) and it has held up well . i 'm definitely bookmarking this to buy"
__label__0 "i chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure but was disappointed . the fabric is a beautiful soft fine silk but unforgiving . the cut is not truly a wrap and with a fixed thin elastic waistband was too short waisted for me . while the model looks elongated the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections ... not flattering at all . while i was drawn to the shape for my body type it may be better suited to another . happy hunting !"

__label__0 "i loved the look of this tunic . it is made well and very pretty . it was so big and heavy i had to return it . i think the small in this would be too big ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it 's a much lovelier color in person but that 's about it for me . thoughts below : _____________ pros : - tts . i ordered the medium for my 36c 5 ' 9 frame and found it sufficient . - the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned . it 's a richer brown . think mocha latte in terms of color . - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
__label__0 "i bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack . the pattern did n't help anything looking totally faded and washed out ... the fabric and overall quality is nice but the fit and pattern are just so .. ugly unfortunately . had to return it ."
__label__1 "i tried these on at the store and the fit was good the length was even ok for me as a petite person . the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton which i like . but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs so it was n't ultimately something i felt i would wear . still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half ."
__label__0 "i love these overalls but they run very small ? i had to return and reorder ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress online this morning went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it ! i love this brand because the designs are modest but feminine and practical . this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery . the fit is tts and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug . the length is just above my knee at 5 ' 3 . i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress . it really has no style . i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung . i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight . had to return it ."

__label__-1 "i tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5 ' 4 120 lbs . i had trouble getting my head through the dress and once i did it felt so tight at the neck as if it was chocking me . the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no . i would not recommend this dress for those reasons ."

__label__1 "trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts . never thought i 'd find both in one top . love this ! i put it on and knew i had to take it home . it 's fitted but not busy but just enough so and it 's made in the usa ! ca n't go wrong ."
__label__-1 "this is an extremely flattering dress . i could n't resist buying it even though i did n't come into the store looking for a dressier dress which i feel this is . once i tried it on i had to purchase it . its one of those things that i know i wo n't regret because at some point an occasion will show up that i 'll wear it to . its soft comfy and flowing and accentuates the body 's curves without being too tight or clingy . its a classic !"
__label__1 "i ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week and this is by far my favorite purchase ! the detail is gorgeous it 's very soft and figure flattering ."
__label__-1 "perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller but the knees on these were baggie by lunch . they are very soft and comfortable but i would n't buy them again ."
__label__-1 "i too will be returning this sweater . love the style shape and fabric but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__-1 "i was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews ; the combination of peplum cap sleeves and color seemed too good to be true . i ordered a size medium but unfortunately this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out . in addition the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower too . a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i did n't bother . i returned it to the store ."
__label__0 "i like the feel and color of this blouse . however i was very disappointed with the sizing . i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse it fits way too big . it is a bummer because the curve is not even visible when i wear it ."
__label__-1 "material is too thin and quality is poor"
__label__1 "this was a winner retailer ! ! ! ! ! bought it with my birthday discount . a bit pricey but when i wore it ( over and over again ) i can see why . the material is so soft flows beautifully and is just the right length on me . i am petite ( 5 ' 3 ) slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels just like the model . i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again . i have received many compliments on this dress . bought the washed denim look . thank you ! ! ! !"
__label__1 "recently bought these on sale though they were still a bit in the expensive side . i 'm 5 ' 2 and typically a size 4 the xs fits perfectly . the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model but i 'm fine with that . the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy as sometimes happens with this style ."
__label__0 "lovely fabric color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i ca n't even imagine wearing it over leggings . i felt like i was wearing a dress . there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored ( i do n't buy sewing or ironing ) . disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in size xl in ivory . it was a drab poorly-made too-small sweater . the knit material was n't good quality and the overall fit did n't work . i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock then i would have overlooked the problems . but there are better ivory retailer cardigans available . this was returned ."
__label__-1 "loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online . i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more normal cut . hip length and slimming the fabric and collar are beautiful !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on . the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me . it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it 's tts up top ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt . it 's different than other summer tops . it 's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size and runs true to size . on a windy day the front will come open but only to your stomach ."
__label__0 "the fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist . this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous . i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return . i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing . maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower ."
__label__-1 "this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well . i did not find it to be well made . the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places . i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay . putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach . for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store . but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash ( even when following washing instructions ) . i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially ! i 'm so disappointed . how can you make a shirt that ca n't withstand washing ? !"
__label__-1 "the fabric and color are absolutely beautiful . the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist and enormous everywhere else . it was not flattering ."
__label__0 "this dress has great potential . i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off . as a previous review stated it 's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree the hem is also funky . i am still deciding if i want to keep it but if i do i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0 ."
__label__-1 "i was so disappointed with the quality of this dress especially because it looks so beautiful on the model . the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash it 's already developing a tiny hole and pilling . also it is definitely not a day dress -- i wore it as a swim coverup but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress . the color is much different in person -- the blue is brighter and for lack of a better way to describe it cheap looking . the white banding around the t"
__label__0 "the top is a pretty and has a nice pattern . it does run large and is it a bit billowy . i am 5 ' 4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better ) . however the top swallowed me up and was unflattering . the colors are true to the picture .. not very bright but would be a nice transition to fall top . the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better ."
__label__0 "this is a very pretty jacket . light weight and perfect for spring/fall . i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store . i did end up returning it though . it does run large i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look ! i was sad to have to send this one back ! i was hoping to love it ! someone smaller might love it ! !"
__label__0 "i love the colors in this top but i returned it for a few reasons . the material is extremely fragile ; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it . my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me . i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top . i 'm 5 ' 6 and it just did n't look that way on me ."
__label__-1 "i know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level . i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference . if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify ."
__label__0 "the print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch . unfortunately it runs quite small in the bust so i had to return it . for someone that is small busted it will be quite cute . everywhere else it is true to size ."
__label__-1 "this could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank . i am 5 ' 3 but do have a long torso . it did not fully cover my booty ."
__label__-1 "i ordered in blue . so excited at arrival ; it looked gorgeous ... then i tried it on ! i 'm 5 ' 106 # 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular . i normally order 2p ( sometimes 0p ) ... and never a problem . this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms ... if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams ! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized or defective . all i can say if you have skinny arms you 'll love it ."
__label__1 "this skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely . i 've paired it with black and the contrast is very nice . the material is thick enough for winter but will also work for the fall months too ."
__label__-1 "too small ... too flare ... nice thick fabric . not my favorite pant ."
__label__-1 "i just got this in the mail the other day . i was really excited and then crushed . one buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo . it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling . it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours . i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail . it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back . too bad but not what i bought and then not"
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewers ; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way . the rest of it was beautiful though . looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just is n't for me . the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable . the fit is not quite right on me . the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt . i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not . it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me ."
__label__-1 "i was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased -- hoping to try something new . they 're not attractive . the slit stays open with any movement . i do n't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size . i otherwise liked the design but the sleeves made this a quick return ...."

__label__-1 "the color is completely off ! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture ! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment . it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture . very pale . horrible ."
__label__-1 "this top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag with only a quick ironing . unfortunately the first time i washed it ( cold water hang dry ) it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy is much shorter and feels rougher to the touch . like another reviewer said ( unfortunately after i had purchased and washed ! ) i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno"

__label__1 "i love this top ! it 's well-made ( important if you 're in chlorine or salt water ) and has vibrant colors . the back strap has two clasp options so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you do n't have a big bow to lay on when laying out ."
__label__-1 "this tank ( in black ) is nice quality most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well . it 's just too short and too boxy for my figure ( curvy/hips ) . would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted . since that does n't describe me it has to go back ."

__label__1 "i was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack . however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love . it draped beautiful the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled . i feel iike i will use for many seasons ."
__label__1 "i needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine . it is n't as slimming as i had hoped for because it is n't a stretchier denim . but my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit . pants are not easy for me . i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist . quality is good ."
__label__-1 "i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it . i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it . the fabric is made of cheap poly that 's shiny thin and clingy . it shows every lump and bump you have . the zipper at the back wo n't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump . the sewing and hemline is uneven . there was n't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"

__label__0 "i was excited to order this sweater . when it arrived the green did n't stand out as much as the picture here . it also felt too itchy . i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i ca n't stand plain thick heavy wool . this one was just too itchy for me it is going back ."

__label__0 "i love cashmere love the length cowl-neck and colors however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person which i liked . i 'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste . i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater ... i might justify this one at a sale price ."
__label__-1 "loved how this draped and im super petite 5 ' 1 ( 32b bust ) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned . i purchased the pxs and it was huge . i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review . i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off . unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest . too sad retailer please get the fit right ! !"

__label__-1 "i really liked the casual style of this top but i was disappointed when i put it on . it 's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just do n't seem to hang right . they do n't hit where they 're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured more like 3/4 which i did n't like . the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off . i tried xs and s. both fit weird ."
__label__-1 "only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed . meh ."
__label__-1 "per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium . it was still tight around the girls ( and i 'm not that well endowed ) but too big in the armholes . the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material . i kept it ( because i 'm lazy ) but not sure how much i 'll wear it given the strange fit ."
__label__-1 "i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than 5 times . it was not a fit issue or a seam issue ; they literally just frayed apart in two areas . while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durable ... they are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them ."

__label__0 "this dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much . i am 5 ' 1.5 and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing . the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers . there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me . i hope to try this in a 4p ."
__label__0 "i love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress . unfortunately the fit was just bad . the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets . do n't think another size or tailoring would address the issue . for size i am 5 ' 4 130 and ordered the 6 ."
__label__0 "i saw this top on sale and tried it on right away . my normal medium was too big so i purchased the small in the rose color . wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans . wow what an outfit ! ! ! ! then i washed it according to directions and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank . i was so disappointed . i wished i had read the reviews beforehand ."
__label__0 "like the previous reviewer the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is . i 'm 5 ' 4 and ordered a 12 which is usually what i wear at retailer . even only being 5 ' 4 this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated . it fits everywhere else though . i 'm obsessed with the back so i 'm going to keep it and wear it . i 'd say it 's worth it at the sale price ."
__label__-1 "i noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great . she 's probably 230lbs and about 5 ' 5 . tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice . i 'm 5 ' 8 and the ruffles started right under my chest . i gave 2 stars bc of the material it is light and summery ."
__label__1 "i loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel . i went ahead and ordered the cat one today . the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down . for myself m was perfect since i 'm built larger and broader on top . the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom . it 's a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types ."
__label__0 "this is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it . it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy but unfortunately it did n't work for me . i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else . so perhaps this works better for the smaller chested . additionally and this was n't so much of a con and just something to note the fabric is pretty see-through . it works for the"

__label__0 "i have to send the skirt back . i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high the underskirt bunches and the fabric snags easily . additionally the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band . disappointed in the quality of this skirt given the pretty steep price ."

__label__0 "it feels soft and like a good quality . however it really does run large and long . i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape did n't work out . i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it did n't . also wrinkles easily ."

__label__0 "it 's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory . looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color . the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester slightly scratchy feel . sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat ."
__label__-1 "this dress is great if you 're very skinny and have no chest . otherwise it makes you look dowdy . the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion . this one is going back ."

__label__0 "really wanted to like this top . the model has it on backwards - the v is actually the back and closes with an eye hook ( that is where the tag is ? there 's also a seam running down the back ) . the front is actually a high round neck . the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap . i 'm usually a s or xs . in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely . the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up ."
__label__0 "material and color is nice . the leg opening is very large . i am 5 ' 1 ( 100 # ) and the length hits me right above my ankle . with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look . if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you ."
__label__-1 "this skirt looks great on i did n't even think before buying it planning to wear it all summer . so the aesthetic is great . quality and design not so much . you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates it is not sewn in or built to last . then it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt . i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it but they said they would have to resew the whole garment not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran"
__label__-1 "i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress ! when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model . the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled . if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering . i looked so top heavy in this dress ! definitely not worth the price . so disappointed ."
__label__-1 "this romper fit like a dream ! it is gorgeous unique and sexy . i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on ! there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top . nobody 's got time for that ! ! ! ! i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend 's 40th birthday party . but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off . no thank you ! i considered buying the romp"
__label__0 "i was disappointed in this bordeaux top a brand i usually enjoy . i ordered a medium my usual size in their tops . it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here . also the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it ."
__label__1 "i love this jacket . let 's be clear though ... it 's not for warmth just for style but it 's perfect for fall in california . i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers a light blue tank off white shirt tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit . love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often . i bought my usual size small . sleeves are a bit long for my 5 ' 4 frame but they did n't have in petite and it looks great ."
__label__0 "purchased the gray patterned top . seemed to fit tts but it did n't fit me . i 'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just would n't fit right around the shoulder/neck area . i 'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well . nice length all around ... top and sleeves ."
__label__0 "i love this dress i mean it si really pretty in person however the breast area is just too small ... i ca n't wear a bra with it and my older breasts just droop not flattering . they are barely covered ... i am a bit disappointed at that but if you are smaller up there i say give it a try ... i am 115 lbs 26.5 ion waist 30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest . colors and fabric are great i love that the different colors are different types of fabric ... too bad ."
__label__-1 "i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed . loved the skirt part of it . but the top which i guess i did n't see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides . would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool ."
__label__-1 "do n't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger . order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size . i ordered an xs and it 's more like a medium or large ."
__label__-1 "i wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it . the color of the dress ( green ) was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much . i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large ; but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips ( which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot ! ) . the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making"
__label__0 "i liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy . fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me . may look better on a different body type ."
__label__-1 "this fell apart after wearing it once . for the price it should hold up better . it 's too delicate ."
__label__0 "i have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress . i was buying it as a stylish modern alternative to a business suit . i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions . tailored conservative and edgy at the same time . several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs i thought . but it did not . the best description for the dress is blah average . the material is textures and crinkly not slick . the top is cream/ivory color"
__label__0 "this dress is most definitely not a maxi ! barely goes below the knees . also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice . there are no folds which were an added plus on picture . waist is higher not at natural waist . very pretty silk though and still cute . just not as pictured ."
__label__1 "love this blouse . per the previous review there was no problem with my tailoring . it is exactly as shown . i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it . you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office . i do think it runs a tiny bit small . however it is not short . it 's just quite a fitted piece . i would consider sizing up . i love the look of the medium on me 5'10"
__label__0 "i got the pink version . it is a pretty color but the metallic border is painted not a metallic yarn . the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy . it looks cheap to me -- not what i expect from retailer . am returning ."
__label__-1 "bought a large could barely pull up over my butt . runs extremely small . it 's cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you ."
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"
__label__1 "i love this jacket . it 's easy to dress up or be casual . the black is more like a very dark grey ."
__label__1 "this is a great blouse . the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it . i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer . i am 5 ' 7 long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6 -- this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering . it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans . it would also be swell with a pencil skirt . it will cover any fashion flaws ! i usually like to shop the s"
__label__0 "i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite . it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything . it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me . it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just did n't lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i did n't find to be very flattering . so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on . alas it is going"
__label__-1 "fabric much heavier than looks in picture . also nothing mentioned in the description . great color and fit but i live in florida ."
__label__-1 "this shirt fits very closely to the body . it has a very strange fit in the shoulder though . the arms themselves are really long far past my hands yet it 's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area . for reference i am 5'10 130 pounds and ordered a small which is what i usually need ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 50 and weigh 105 lbs . i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide and big all over . it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model . also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long . this would work better on a taller person . i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big . the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute ."
__label__1 "fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate . took my usual size four i am moderately short waisted ."
__label__0 "i was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog . i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs . it was huge . reminded me of a maternity top . it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model . the material was nice thin but not see through . the macrame detailing seemed well made . i 'd recommend this if you 're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down ."
__label__-1 "hei hei is my favorite line . i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand . i ordered these in the green and they arrived today . they fit me as if they were an xxl . i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same . obviously they are going back tomorrow . i 'm very disappointed they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in blue and loved the color . i 'm not typically into the flowing top style but i tried a few items on my last order this being one . it 's unseamed at the bottom which was my primary reason for returning it - i could n't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style this item is good quality soft comfortable material and a great spring or fall blue ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big . unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back . i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it does n't look right . it is not as pictured as well . the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning ."
__label__0 "i purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price . i ordered the 2 petite but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person . they are still very long ( to my ankles ) and the legs are very wide . the waist fits fine though ."
__label__0 "i loved the lines in this jacket but ended up returning it because they did n't show up how i expected . the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit ( s on my usual s/4/6 ) and was n't quite what i was looking for ."
__label__1 "lovely top that seems to flatter all body types . fit is great fabric is soft style is lovely ... great to dress up or throw on with jeans ."
__label__1 "this dress stunning for the hourglass figure . the hips may be a little narrow . i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best . i read some reviews that said the hips were snug . it 's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering . shoulders are a little loose and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest . i 'm 5 ' 4 32dd waist 27 and 130 lbs ."
__label__1 "i ordered size small . i am 5 ' 6 32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great . there 's an adorable little quote on the pantie 's lining and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining . the feel of the lace and fabric is divine . love it ! one more thing to note ... there is very little lining in the bra ; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric . it is enough to protect modesty but not much else ."
__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."
__label__1 "love this shirt . the print is a little loud but cute . i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy . however that was a mistake with this shirt . there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size . i did like it enough to order again in the correct size ( l ) . i am a size 14 and busty if that helps . the red is short-sleeved by the way if ordered online cute and flattering ."
__label__0 "the details on this dress were pretty but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am . maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure . fits tts ."
__label__-1 "top is completely see through . i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like . it is a cute design but not practical at all ."
__label__0 "this dress is stunning no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly . however the fact that this dress has zero stretch ( which is fine if that 's what you 're looking for ) coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on . i 'm normally a 14/16 at retailer and i ordered the 16 just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist"
__label__-1 "the image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24 utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps . the zipper pull when closed sat right on my collarbone which was he height of discomfort . it felt heavy and awkward . the dress was very high waisted for me ( i 'm 5 ' 6 and it was 3 inches above the navel ) ) also to the point of discomfort . an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing . the fabric is quite beautifu"
__label__0 "as much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape . also i thought it was shorter than it looked online . i had to return this piece ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer . but it 's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short . the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically . had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve ."
__label__-1 "i was very disappointed with my recent retailer order . i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front . i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric . sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition . very disappointing ."
__label__0 "my normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well . these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips too loose in the waist and too tight in the knees and i do n't have big knees . also the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length . cuffed they seem to have a 32 inch inseam and these were regular not tall . basically i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves and very long legs for this jean to work ."
__label__0 "i ordered the xxs p but the actual cardigan is a xs p. i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out . well it fits ok anyway . ( 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ) beautiful sweater but oh so itchy . i think wool should be listed first ( like ingredients ) it is really itchy . why i so torn . i want to keep it because it is nice but it is itchy . i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath i do n't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless . colors and pattern are warm neutral not red ."
__label__-1 "i was surprised at the positive reviews for this product . its terrible ! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide . the skirt is also not like the picture . its darker and heavier . the material isnt great . i had to return ."
__label__0 "cute pattern but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short !"
__label__1 "i love wearing this . it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to . the color pops it 's so very comfortable & the back is a work of art ! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants ."
__label__-1 "i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent . not even remotely flattering . i thought about ordering it in an xs however i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric . back it goes ."
__label__0 "the top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature . however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me . the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering . i have a medium on in the photo my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__1 "anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down i have to buy it . fit is always so flattering comfy and the prints are always great !"
__label__1 "i bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it . the color is lovely . i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully . i am so glad ! such an easy piece to throw on very comfortable . fit is great ."
__label__0 "it was love at first sight when i saw this dress online . i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing . i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful ... until i put it on . fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back . not sure if it 's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there 's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice does n't lie flat"
__label__0 "i ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality . the only problem is the size of the slip . the top is very tight across my average chest but fine elsewhere - odd fit . the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip but ultimately decided to return it ."
__label__1 "beautiful color and super comfy . it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top ."
__label__1 "this shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully . i am 5 ' 7 175 and the medium fits perfectly . i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top . bummer ! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up ."
__label__1 "i love these pants ! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work ! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional ! these are also nice and long for wearing heels . i ordered a size 27 and they fit great . i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing ."
__label__1 "this top is very comfortable and really cute on . the material is super soft . i bought the white and am very happy with it but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it . i would definitely recommend !"
__label__-1 "i was obsessed with this top . i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders . the slight puff was too far in it did n't hit on my shoulder . so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders . i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned . i had no hope for an 8 ."
__label__0 "i was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back . i am 5 ' 6 120 and usually a s fits . however this was really tight . also the material is really really thin for the $ 90 price-tag . save yourself some money and avoid this one ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing but the arm holes are huge ! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly did n't work ."
__label__-1 "it was very pretty but it ran very big sadly i had to return it ."
__label__0 "i purchased this dress for the second time : it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white . same dress new name and color . generally this dress is large overall and long . i wish i could have purchased the petite size . i liked it enough to have it in black and white . this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better . recommendation : order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large . the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing ."
__label__0 "1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend . but not great on me . i 'm pretty standard in size/build : 5 ' 6 135 lbs size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on . 2. and maybe this is the issue : the size 27 ( my normal size in every citizen pant i own ) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me . i mean i felt great about myself . but ... wowza . 3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange they do n't even carry them in the store ! so i just returned and will try something else ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in black and white thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles . i returned the black because it looked like polyester . the white is actually a cream/ivory not bright white as pictured . it is also not the best feeling quality however the fit is good and true to size ."
__label__1 "i have a short torso and short arms so i purchased this in a petite medium . i probably could 've worn the ps but i do like the little extra room . it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today 's trendy frayed edge to make it contemporary . the fabric is super soft and lays nicely . i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories ! looking forward to it ."
__label__0 "very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties . did n't lay well on chest for me . returned it ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful shirt . i purchased the top in navy the silver touch is pretty . i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect tts . great for work or casual party ."
__label__0 "the lining is shorter than the top so i keep pulling it down . also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors . it is not evenly cut . i do like the color and style of the shirt just not the quality ."
__label__-1 "i was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online . however i was very disappointed when i finally received it . the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person . i could almost get over the sleeves but the white part of the shirt was horrible . i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer and i got a small in this top . the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line -- which i"
__label__1 "i bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them . i definitely need a 27 ( 39 inch hips 33 low waist 31 waist ) . i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants . even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5 ' 9 frame . they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model . if you are shorter i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look . the material is not bright white wi"
__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store . it looked frumpy . the ruching was not flattering . the fabric felt cheap . i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a wow look . i 'm 5 ' 1 107lbs and the 0p fit fine ."
__label__-1 "i recently purchased this blouse on their 40 % off sale in white . i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse . i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway . it is awful . there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning . it feels like a napkin or thinner . not even worth the extra sale price . i will be returning ."
__label__1 "just bought this at the store . just to be safe i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size . that was a good idea . ( i am a 38b 5 ' 9 and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts . ) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest . when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length -- the large was > 1 longer than the medium . i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok ."
__label__0 "originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping . the fit is completely different . i am a consistent small particularly in dresses of this style . will be exchanging this for a medium which i hope will fit . love the color and pattern ."
__label__1 "this hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be ... it is super soft comfortably loose but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it 's just the right amount of sexy . it will be my go-to this fall and winter !"
__label__1 "very much in love with this ethereal delicate dress . the silk is very light and slightly clingy so take caution when wearing . the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with . the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite . those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down otherwise tts . for reference i am 5 ' 3 36dd 140 #"
__label__1 "the colors on these leggings are just beautiful ! the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it . no issues with see thru material . i am 5 ' 8 145 and i ordered my usual medium ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit . jumpsuits are always tricky for me but this one fits like a dream . i would say it runs true to size with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest . you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part . that 's not typically a problem for me being a 32d . i do n't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais"
__label__-1 "what a shame this dress is . i wear xl and am 5 ' 2 but the dress in the store in the size xs ( ! ! ! ! ! ) looked just the right size . yup ! xs was just the right size . i ca n't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering . it would look like a sack . it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__-1 "i thought it was going to be so pretty . it is ugly on . the macrame is thick stiff and rough . the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless . yuk !"
__label__-1 "i am not in love with this top and will be returning it . from the front it looks like a basic tee ( which i expected ) but the back x is too loose and slumps to the side so that it does n't look like an x as the picture shows . so basically the focal point of the tee falls short ."
__label__-1 "had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits . however that was not the case . this skirt is not lined and the material is so so . basically for the price i was underwhelmed and will return it ."
__label__1 "i love this top . very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways . it is tight on the bottom . i usually wear an xs ( 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs ) . had to exchange for a small . very flattering . liked it so much i ordered it in both colors ."
__label__1 "this is m frist pair of flares and i love them -- make my legs look miles long and they 're also my most comfortable jeans . i 'm 5 ' 4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips -- the 25 fits perfectly . i 've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor ( longer than on the model but i like that look ; if i wanted to wear them with flats they 'd need to be hemmed but i prefer heels anyway ) ii 've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they 'd look matronly but combined with the flare the high waist is"
__label__1 "i am pleased with this skirt . the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips . i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse . i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure ."
__label__0 "this top runs large . i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small . the medium was a little loose in the bust but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist . my figure was lost in the fabric . the small was too small for me in the bust although the waist looked more flattering . the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer ."
__label__0 "this dress is n't as fitted as it looks on the model . it appear to be more of a shift dress . as gorgeous as the print and quality are it does n't look great on me . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 105lbs and bought xs . for whatever reason the high neckline is n't flattering on me . i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders ."
__label__1 "when i was purchasing this i asked to myself do i really need another black jacket . when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket . this jacket is special . it is light weight - but structured . it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing . this jacket is my new favorite ."
__label__0 "this dress is very good quality with beautiful beading on the bodice . it 's a heavier material than i was expecting but that was a pleasant surprise . unfortunately when i put it on and looked in the mirror i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid . the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and combined with the overall design and length i could n't think of anywhere to wear it . this is an easy return for me . the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit"
__label__-1 "loved this online but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky ."
__label__0 "i loved almost everything about this skirt . thick and lined and love the buttons . comfortable . the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom presumably from the buttons . i was torn but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back ."
__label__-1 "the dress is beautiful on the model . in person it 's sheer but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great . i am 5 ' 4 and the petite was too short and the regular too long . both are very boxy and seem to run big . even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect . i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited about this top and so disappointed when it arrived today . the lace part is lovely but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides . it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated and there is no way to get it to lay flat . the back center section is pleated . why could n't they have had the pleats all around ? this will be going back with much regret ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i think the proportions are very weird . i 'm 5 ' 7 and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses . it runs small throughout and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work . the front is nicely detailed but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing . i tried on three different sizes ( 8 10 and 12 ) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest . there 's a little slip that goes with the dress w"
__label__-1 "finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed . i am swimming in the xs ( 5 ' 4 110lbs ) . the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green the red is much more red than rust colored etc . and it 's a sweater coat ! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality . i do n't doubt that it will be warm but ca n't justify the price . it 's going back to the store ."
__label__-1 "this sweater has the weirdest stitching although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die ... poor fit means poor sweater : )"
__label__0 "i tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different awkward hem line . they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked . finally found one that was n't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs . i am a curvy athletic build with broad shoulders and small waist for your reference ."
__label__-1 "every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye . there was never a large or xl to try on ; however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both . the xl was too large ; the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck . if i would have kept one it would have been the large ; however they are both going back . a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is"

__label__-1 "this is a very pretty sweater a bit boxy and short but cute . i am 5 ' 1 and ordered the regular xs in black . the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace . i would have kept this if it was plain black lace . just did not like that look ."

__label__-1 "the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because it 's tissue-paper thin . also i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit . i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large . the armholes hit halfway to my waist . obviously i did n't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned ."
__label__0 "i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater : the stitch is pretty but the fabric is n't nearly as soft as i expected . it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater . that said the fit is pretty flattering . i did n't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model . i 've been looking for this style of sweater so i 'll probably keep it . however it really did n't meet my expectations for quality ."
__label__1 "i received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror . it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans . i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see . the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure . it is longer as it appears on the model . i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price !"

__label__1 "i ordered this top in xs and blue its subtle but pretty on as the style gives it a boost . it is a bit snug in the shoulders ( cut a little snug in armpit ? ) but i would not want it larger . it does not affect the appearance is not uncomfortable just noticeable when moving arms around . nice fall top want to try with blue or white jeans and boots ."
__label__-1 "this jacket was cute however i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare . this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders . it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me . this jacket is not sized correctly ."
__label__0 "i liked this top i really did . i also liked the subtle shimmer . the fabric did n't seem as soft but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back . you can see it on the model here but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just did n't look right . asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large but here it is . the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader . i am sending it back ."
__label__1 "i really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived . i have n't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt . i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors . all in all very versatile and i recommend them ."

__label__0 "i really could n't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small . design is great with cross straps in the back thin silky fabric . i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i 'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs . . ."
__label__1 "oh my ! this dress fits wonderfully on ! so ready for autumn ! i have a big bust this dress does not split at the buttons ."
__label__-1 "as the previous reviewer mentioned the pockets ruin this dress . pockets usually such a good idea ! but here they 're misplaced ( right on the hips ) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress ... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets . this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss ."
__label__0 "gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be . in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade . i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends . i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for ."

__label__0 "i ordered this in lime which is one of my fave colors . the garment was loose and roomy and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist i would have been in love ! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies ' room i had to plan ahead . i took it on a trip and did n't have time to try on prior to leaving ."
__label__-1 ".... that 's what i look like wearing this dress . a sad sad sack . the fabric is less than ideal and there is no shape to speak of . i love that it has pockets but that 's about it . there was just way too much fabric for a petite person . this dress has got to be good on someone sadly that person was not me ."

__label__-1 "i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired . it fits tts length is fine ... the inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap ( kinda canvas feeling ? ) . the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way . it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm . this is definitely going back ."

__label__0 "i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks . unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it . it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top . it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all . sadly i will be returning it . i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to try these on at my local retailer . i 'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off . the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward . they were also not as soft as i expected them to be ."

__label__1 "i sadly only noticed this top once on sale . i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind ( 115 lbs 30dd ) - but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways ... love the subtle polka dots ... oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love !"
__label__1 "just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top . the colors are pretty and vibrant . i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top . dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back . it looks fantastic with jeans . as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it . it 's an all year round top . throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go . a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it ."

__label__0 "love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online however it falls a little short once in person . it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines did n't make it appear as a swing dress highlighting your figure . i wish this could have worked however it felt a little too unshapely ."

__label__0 "bought this on a whim . i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online . ordered it in black . it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line ... it leaves a love handle lump . without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool . however i am on the fence on this one . for the money there are better maxis out there ."

__label__0 "i am usually a size 2 in tops . i am very very rarely a size 0 so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does . obviously this is designed to be a loose flowing top . that 's why i wanted to order it . however the 2 is simply too loose in every direction . my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i do n't think it intended . i do really like the styling and quality so i am planning on"

__label__1 "i am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit . however the petite looks great and the length is perfect . it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings . i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose . i am 5 ' 3 and 125lbs . this will be my go to for fall ! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater !"

__label__1 "i had this on my wish list but saw it as a on of on black friday .... and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect ... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer . it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer ! the detailing is loely ! even tho it is 40 % off today ( i got it with the 25 % off store wide sale ) my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did . just in time for all the christmas"
__label__0 "i had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven . its shorter in the back and falls weird . i love the color even better than the picture . but quality is lacking for this high price . i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too . bummer"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this top . in person though the fit was too large and boxy . i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike . i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting . the material was nice and lightweight . perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust ."
__label__0 "i have a love/hate relationship with these jeans . when i first put them on i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans . everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size ! but then two hours later they were sagging . the fabric is so cozy but it just stretches too much too fast . i am not willing to give up yet so i ordered another pair in a smaller size . i 'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $ $ for two pairs but i r"
__label__0 "frustrated that the details do n't mention there 's a side zip . for whatever reason i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it 's a pull-on style when that 's not the case . there 's also no give in the waist . besides the fit not working for me it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on ."
__label__0 "the fabric is so soft but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it did n't flatter my body ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other review . the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made . the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality ; however the shirt is very wide . i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big . the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance ."
__label__1 "i love this top . of course i love most things that are denim or look like denim . this is a fun twist on a denim shirt the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching . i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it ! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional ."
__label__0 "i was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured . there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse . i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it ."
__label__-1 "my conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened ! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized . but i also loved the design and ca n't resist anything with mustard yellow . i was instantly disappointed when i received it almost did n't even try it on . how can they possibly charge $ 185 for terrible itchy 80 's acrylic ? it looks cheap it feels cheap and it did n't even fit well . only redeeming quality : easily returnable !"
__label__1 "i rarely buy anything at full price at retailer . but after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i could n't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life ! i 'm 5 feet tall and a size 12 so this was definitely a maxi on me . but there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats . i 'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me . even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add"

__label__1 "girls this dress is gorgeous . but if you are an a/b cup there is just too much fabric in the bust . the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number . alas i had to send it back and was very sad to do so ."
__label__1 "i ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5 ' 8 with a long-ish torso . i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it 's fairly short . color was gorgeous . the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me . those with small chests may have better luck . i left like a suburban mom in it ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress for summer celebrations . the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress . the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front . i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket . definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down . very feminine and has a romantic feel ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband . and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up . the cut is a disaster the quality is terrible and the dress just plain did n't work . the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast . the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi"

__label__0 "according to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10 but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i do n't keep any fat . i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12 but i could n't breath with the 12 on . for reference i am 34ddd . it was the 34 part that did n't fit the ddd would have fit fine i think ."
__label__0 "i love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish : ( really sad because the material is gorgeous ! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine . i 'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women . the only complaint is have is that the straps seem delicate . the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though !"

__label__1 "i was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model ( i am a more typical 50 year old mom body ) and i have never worn a peplum style . i put it on for my husband and approved so i wore it . i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone ' with the style !"
__label__1 "this is a super flattering cute tank ! i 've purchased it in several colors because it 's such a great fit . somewhat thin material and slightly sheer ( especially the white ) . i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit ' fat shows . looks great with pilcro capris for a cute casual summer look ! i wish they would come out with even more colors !"
__label__0 "just received two the red and the black . the black is a great print very versatile . both run large but the black most significantly so . the red is close enough to fitting to keep . the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply . ( the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area but ( barely ) covers my bra . the material is somewhat thinner than expected but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra would n't be sufficient ."
__label__-1 "i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short - i do n't even have a long torso ! sadly it 's going back to the store ."
__label__1 "comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes . this shirt meets both requirement . it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up . must have for fall and winter ."
__label__1 "i love the fit of this tee for everyday wear . it 's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee . my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear . otherwise the fit style and fabric weight are great . it fits tts . i 'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly ."
__label__-1 "i saw this at the store today . very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on ! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through ! from what i could see on my body it would have been too short in the crotch . i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely . i gave up . cute shade of green though ."
__label__-1 "i did n't realize that there were sequins on the design . they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable . the white material was also not very flattering on me . it went back ."
__label__1 "in truth it looks better in the photo . i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent . however i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties ."
__label__0 "very boxy top not flattering on . i will be returning ."
__label__0 "so this shirt is adorable . soft fun lays nicely ... but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie 's before you put it on . i do n't even have large arms the medium fit me perfectly but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams . this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection . i mean i 'm not a large ? but i guess if i want this shirt i will need to take it back and get a large otherwise it will be sleev"

__label__1 "loved this dress . fit like a glove so flattering and perfect for a summer/fall wedding . material is substantial and dress is well made . i 'm 5 ' 4 large chest and curvy and a size 6 fit perfectly . longer than seen on the model for me but i actually love it being tea-length . a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it poof . i removed it but looks good either way ."
__label__-1 "bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me . the colors were n't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge . not flattering and it went back . i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved . not hard to do at all"
__label__1 "it was hard for me to rate how this was sized-it is tight through the bust very baggy and boxy through the body and short . looked gorgeous on the hanger though !"
__label__1 "i saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on . it is a beautifully made dress . lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket . feels very boho and chic . i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress . i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person . worth every penny . wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for 38c on top ."
__label__-1 "this shirt has absolutely no shape . look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt . the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt . i even ordered the xs at 5 ' 7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy . returned ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! yes it is quite transparent but just needs a light colored cami ( i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer ) ! it 's incredibly soft and light for summer time . the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern . i also really like the sewn in v-neck line . it gives the shirt a more professional touch . i 'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer ."
__label__-1 "i am so sad i have to return these leggings . they 're adorable -- so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them -- but as other reviewers have pointed out there 's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they 'll fall down ! why sleeping on snow ? whyyyyyyyyyyy ? they 're so great otherwise !"
__label__0 "i love how this dress is photographed but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed . there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever . the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on . this one is going back ."
__label__-1 "this was so boxy and unflattering . i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag . was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit . sizing down would not help this one . went back !"

__label__-1 "should have listened 2 a previous review ! while this is a very well made garment it really does remind me of a bathrobe and will be returning : ( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great . also ... this runs very large . the extra small was more like a medium ."
__label__0 "wanted to love this dress as it 's perfect for transition . i 'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off . my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it . i would implore the maker to try this style again as it 's a good one unfortunately the sizing was it 's downfall ."
__label__0 "the dress is precious and looks good on all body types . however the bust is extremely tight . i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area ."
__label__0 "i purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers . while the cut is fine the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through . will be returning it ."
__label__1 "i have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric . i 'm on the taller side at 5 ' 7 and found this to fit perfectly yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room . awesome !"
__label__-1 "the design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix . it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy . and it is ! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack . it 's perfect for running around town for errands . i actually did n't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces ( yes big surprise ) but he actually commented out of the blue that it 's really sexy . comfy * and * sexy ? ! score !"
__label__1 "beautiful choice ... beautiful fit for my daughter 's slim body"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this sweater . the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms . i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions . i can see it in the picture but did n't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater . slight design flaw ."
__label__-1 "big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat . there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string . the color is great but the quality leaves something to be desired ."
__label__1 "this is a love at first sight item ! bought that home after seeing it on the model . very soft and lovely ! especially love the tie back ! i wore it with a t shirt underneath . i am 5 ' 4 and size small . i bought xs and still a bit long . wish they have petite at the store ."
__label__0 "i like this top . it went well with my olive pant . i tried in l and xl . l was a tad fitted around my tummy . xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low . i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just did n't work . i am busty perhaps it may work better for a slender frame . i recommend this top because it is pretty but the fit is selective so its best to try out a couple of sizes first ."
__label__1 "this bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove . i 'm a true xs bra size 34a . i ordered the small . this was more than worth full price !"

__label__0 "it was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom . the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt . i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it 's definitely not worth $ 60 ."
__label__1 "i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me ( 5 ' 1 ) . but if you do n't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you . the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces ."
__label__1 "this shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag ! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline . love it !"
__label__0 "i just sent this back . it is very cute & the fabric is great so soft & comfy but it does n't work with my shape . it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you do n't have a large chest . on me it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it . am a 34dd . it 's not the fault of the top but a bigger size would have swallowed me . i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model this will be adorable on you . i am just too busty ."
__label__-1 "the design/shape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine . but .... there is no way that the dress i received is new . the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area . there is no tag ... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new . i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received . undoubtedly this one is going back . dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to"

__label__-1 "i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately . it runs so large ! the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy . i do not recommend this ! it hits in all the wrong places ."
__label__-1 "i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest . i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering . i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it . i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown . if there were just less fabric i wo"

__label__1 "these did n't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans . try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom ! i did n't have anything to fill out the hips and seat . for reference i ordered size 25 and they were loose in hip and seat but fit my waist . my hips are 34.5 and waist is 28. they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear but not jeggings thin ."

__label__1 "love the cotton knit for the comfort but from a distance this blouse looks dressier . the embroidery adds a nice flare . personally i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants . i found that it ran a little bit but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway ."
__label__1 "this sweater is a perfect transition piece ! the material is really soft . while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and does n't make you look like a big blob ."
__label__1 "for once i found a peasant top that was n't a balloon . i 'm 5 ' 1 and curvier on top and the small fit great . the blouse billowed a bit but it did n't make me look like a hot air balloon . the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty . the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall . i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this skirt it was good quality but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it"
__label__1 "pretty top . quality material it is not thin and see through . size down because this runs large . although it is meant to be flowy if you do n't size down the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this ! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue . it reminded me of the ocean . however the fit was off . the waist was too high the length too short and the straps to long . i was very disappointed . i considered taking it to the tailor before returning . ultimately i decided to return ."
__label__0 "if you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body . this does n't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist . it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest . also i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons as several were off some of the dresses ."
__label__0 "this shirt is so cute . i ordered a white but will have to return it for a different color . the white is very sheer/shee through !"
__label__0 "i am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big . it 's meant to be a relaxed fit but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big . some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size . i got on here to reorder in a smaller size but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days !"
__label__-1 "was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge . the material is not soft so it does n't fall well . it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant ! !"

__label__1 "i like the top without the fake fur collar . when the collar is removed the neckline 's shape is really nice . the collar seems cheap . i thought the sweater ran true to size . i 'm 5 ' 7 115 lbs . a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage . it was loose there but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath ."

__label__1 "what can i say ? this is a winner ! it is stunning gorgeous a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet . it is classic early 1960s look which is exactly my style ! i am usually a 14 or a 16 so i went with a 16 based on the reviews and it fits divinely . i do n't need another orange dress but this is a keeper !"
__label__0 "this is a lot shinier in person and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size . there is a hi-lo hem going on that does n't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side . due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band it can get crumply on the side if you do n't get the right size . the material feels a little thin and scratchy ."
__label__-1 "i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little . ummmmm no . it 's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model . i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay . i 'm only a 34b weigh 110 pounds 5 ' 3 and it made me look huge and awkward . this is going back !"

__label__0 "i read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it 's very cute . as another 5 ' 3 reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that 's a plus but i have thighs not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs . it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got lost in the sauce . i got ta love it to keep it and i do n't . it 's a great print and fabric though ."
__label__1 "i ordered this for the colors and modern geometric design . colors are as shown . a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans and my burgundy flats . it 's casual and soft enough to wear all day . i wore it to the beach then out to dinner the same evening ! oh ... i spilled red wine on it at the beach and could n't wash it until the next day . i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out completely . i air dried and"
__label__1 "i thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear . i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design . but the sleeves were a bit short on me . and i thought it was a little pricy . i decided against it for those reasons . but if you do n't mind those things then you might like it . it 's definitely worth the try ."

__label__1 "this top is such a great color and style . i did have to go a size down as i typically wear a medium . the style is very forgiving . it looks great with shorts and jeans ! it 's staple !"
__label__0 "i am pretty standard size 8 36c 5 & amp ; # 39 ; 6 & amp ; quot ; 150 lbs . i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste . it was also long so everything was very covered . i didn & amp ; # 39 ; t feel it flattered my build . i returned !"
__label__1 "i love this jacket so much i bought two . it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather . i recommend you grab it while it 's on sale ."
__label__1 "it 's a nice casual dress that you can also dress up but unfortunately it is going back . i got a small since dolan dresses always run large but i usually get a petite . i should 've known this would n't work . i wanted to love it because the top looks great but the length is too long making the waist fall lower than i would like giving my middle a thick appearance.i 'm thin but i 'm not skinny 5 ' 3 with an athletic build and a short torso with a decent size bust ... if that helps . usually i can wear"
__label__-1 "these fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky . no way ."
__label__1 "as the other reviewers stated it does run large i sized down 1 size and it 's perfect . great dress to wear so many ways ."
__label__1 "i have no idea why this has bad reviews ! how is there any left ? ! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green . i love that it comes with a cami . it & # 39 ; s very flattering and not too wide or boxy . the lace detail is amazing ! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect . love this top ! !"
__label__1 "love the dress but ended up returning it as i 'm not sure how often i would wear it . the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress ! ! !"
__label__1 "beautiful in person ! highly recommend : great quality beautiful design flattering !"
__label__1 "just a heads up because i did n't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived . almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic makes it harder to layer in winter black shoes stand out more etc ... but i do n't really like the orange print and i 'm a red head ... so i 'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue . i also bought the emerson swing dress . this dress runs tts ( emerson runs a touch larger ) . i 'm 5 ' 5 and the dress came to just barely above my k"
__label__1 "had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten . i ordered 2 corals one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s ( while my arms were loose in the xs ) . keeping the larger than s xs coral - the color is just lovely . also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands ( for sun protection when i want/need ) . because you can cinch the waist tightly a looser jacket sti"
