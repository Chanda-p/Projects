Emotion Detection Application

I have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, we will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.
Introduction
In this final project, I was assessed on the knowledge gained on all aspects of app creation and its web deployment. I was required to save screenshots of my results from time to time, with specific nomenclature.
In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.
Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.
